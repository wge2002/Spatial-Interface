        observation, stream message or tool reply — `state_trajectory.npz` is read
        by an analysis script, not by the agent.

        `kind` is what makes the file answer a question rather than only describe a
        path. A displacement needs the state BEFORE the motion, and a hold needs
        both of its ends, so the sampler is called at four places — `initial` once

        immediately before a hold advances the sim, and `final` at whichever exit
        the loop took. Without the labels, a reader would have to infer which
        sample was the baseline from the step counts, which is exactly the kind of
        guess an offline verdict must not rest on.

        `sim_state` is MuJoCo's own flattened state, so an object's pose over the
        episode is recoverable exactly rather than through a heuristic about which
        z to watch. `EpisodeRecorder`'s npz is a different thing (per-step camera
