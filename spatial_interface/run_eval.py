"""Outer-loop eval driver: run ONE task across N seeds, all in parallel.

Each seed is an isolated stack on its own SPHINX_BASE_PORT (= exp.base_port +
i*stride), so seeds run at once without interfering. Per seed this driver:
  1. launches a fresh `record_sim.py` for that stack and waits for it to come up,
  2. launches a fresh headless `claude -p` whose MCP server attaches to that
     seed's browser (via SPHINX_BASE_PORT) and drives the gripper to completion,
  3. waits for record_sim to save the episode (verdict.json + video), then
     scrapes the verdict.

Seeds run in a thread pool, up to --max-parallel at once (default: all). Pass
several experiments and they share ONE --max-parallel budget across all their
seeds (ports are allocated globally so concurrent experiments never collide).
Reruns are incremental: a seed that already saved a verdict.json is reused, so a
rerun only fills in the seeds that didn't finish. --print-results skips running
and just reports the verdicts on disk.

Experiments are dataclass configs in EXPERIMENTS. Run from the repo root:
    python -m spatial_interface.run_eval                                   # list experiments
    python -m spatial_interface.run_eval stack-min-opus
    python -m spatial_interface.run_eval stack-min-opus lg8-min-opus -j 4  # both, 4 seeds at a time
    python -m spatial_interface.run_eval stack-min-opus --print-results    # just show verdicts
