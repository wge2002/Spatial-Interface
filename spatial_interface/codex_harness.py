"""OpenAI Codex CLI harness for the eval driver — the Codex counterpart to
the built-in `claude -p` path (see claude_harness.py).

Kept as close as possible to the Claude harness so Claude-vs-Codex results stay
comparable. What is held IDENTICAL:
  * the task prompt (harness.build_prompt, only the guide filename differs);
  * the robot guide (CLAUDE.md) and the per-task instruct_file — delivered to
    Codex as an auto-loaded AGENTS.md instead of Claude's CLAUDE.md + system
    prompt, the same content through the analogous channel;
  * the robot MCP server, translated from the SAME .mcp.json Claude gets via
    --mcp-config (single source of truth for both harnesses);
  * verdict scraping and everything downstream in run_eval (harness-agnostic).

Differences forced by Codex's design, each mitigated to preserve the eval's
intent:
  * Codex's shell tool CANNOT be disabled (unlike Claude's DISALLOWED_TOOLS,
    which strips Read/Bash/etc. so the agent can't read ground-truth off disk).
    We approximate that isolation by (a) running Codex from an empty per-seed
    TEMP dir outside the repo/data tree, so its shell/apply_patch see no repo
    source and no episode artifacts; (b) disabling the two built-ins that could
    otherwise pull data in — `tools.view_image` and `tools.web_search` (Claude
    has no view_image and is denied WebFetch/WebSearch, so this matches); and
    (c) stripping SPHINX_BASE_PORT from the codex process env (the MCP server
    child gets it via the -c env table instead), so the shell can't trivially
    derive record_sim's localhost endpoints (/env.json, /success.json), which
    serve unauthenticated ground truth. Residual risk, accepted: a determined
    agent could still port-scan localhost or infer paths from tool-result text;
    closing that fully would need auth on record_sim's endpoints.
  * Codex can't pre-pin a session id (Claude uses --session-id), so it's parsed
    from the `--json` `thread.started` event after launch; the resume script is
    written then rather than up front.
  * Perception is the inline image the MCP `screenshot` tool returns; Codex
    0.142.5 renders inline MCP image content natively (validated), so view_image
    is unnecessary and safe to disable.
  * Codex exec auto-CANCELS MCP tool calls when nothing can approve them
    ("user cancelled MCP tool call"), so the robot server is marked
    `default_tools_approval_mode="approve"` — a PER-SERVER grant to the one
    server we configure. The shell tool stays under `--sandbox read-only`.
    That combination is deliberately narrower than the blanket
    --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox: the robot tools run, while the
    un-disableable shell can no longer write anywhere, which moves this harness
    CLOSER to Claude's DISALLOWED_TOOLS isolation rather than further from it.

Environment overrides, for a machine where Codex is not a system-wide install:
  * VIA_CODEX_BIN  — path to the codex executable (default: "codex" on PATH);
  * CODEX_HOME     — Codex's runtime home. Honoured everywhere the session
    transcript is located, so a project-private home works (hardcoding
    ~/.codex would silently lose every token count).

    Codex emits token_count events REDUNDANTLY: observed 0.142.5 repeating the

    `last_token_usage` therefore multiplies the bill — measured 49,422 input
    tokens against a true 19,953 on a two-request session (2.5x).

    `total_token_usage` is cumulative and monotonic within a session, so a new
    request has occurred only when that total CHANGES, and the per-request cost is
    the delta. Differencing the cumulative total is thus inherently duplicate-proof,
    where deduping `last_token_usage` by value would also erase two genuinely
    identical consecutive requests.

    A DROP in the cumulative total means the session restarted its accounting (a
    context compaction); that segment's own total is then the delta, so the counts
    of both segments are kept rather than one being subtracted away.
